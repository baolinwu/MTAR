\describe{
  \item{p.value}{ individual trait association test p-values }

\description{
We efficiently compute minimum test p-values (minP) across multiple quantitative traits;
and report two test p-values: 1) Bonferroni corrected minimum p-values (Pbonf) across traits.
2) Analytical significance p-value (Pmin) of minP using asymptotic multivariate normal integration.
See refs in the PGmvn() function.
}
\details{
Remarks: (1) Be cautious to interpret extreme Pmin: it is very hard to accurately compute extreme p-values.
(2) Generally Pmin is close to Pbonf at extreme values under moderate trait correlations.
(3) Under extreme trait correlations, Pmin can offer advantages compared to Pbonf.
(4) Note that theoretically we have minP \eqn{\le} Pmin \eqn{\le} Pbonf.
